            <p>I'm a freshman here at BYUI and I am from Rexburg, Idaho.</p>
            <p>I love to rockclimb, skateboard, and ski. I enjoy spending time with my friends doing anything outdoord and love playing with my dog koda</p> 
            <p>I'm single, and don't know how to expound on that much more. </p>
            <P>From what experience I have in the computing world I can already identify the advantages of learning to code. Careers in web design offer many opportunities for growth and development, not to mention the financial security of a career in this field. I'm taking this course to see if I have the capacity within me to develop websites and if it is interesting to me. I hope to impliment this information into all of my future software classes.</P>
            <p>I have been a member of this church my whole life. Every single one of my family members, instant and extended, are members of the church.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite church quotes is from Dieter F. Uchtdorf and it says "When you have important choices to make, Jesus Christ and His restored gospel are the best choice."</p>
