      <h3>Gear suggestions</h3>
      <p>
        One of the first steps to becoming a successful climber is having the right gear. Now these items don't need to be the most expensive ones out there, but here at Climb Connect we recommend good quality over everything else… Here are the essentials for everything you need as a beginner climber! 
        Rock Climbing Harness, Climbing Shoes, Belay Device, Locking carabiner, Chalk bag and chalk. You'll need a climbing harness unless you're bouldering. Your waist and thighs are put in a rock climbing harness, which enables you to belay your companion and attach to the rope safely for climbing and rappelling. Make sure you purchase a brand-new harness for safety and comfort from a trustworthy supplier.
        Early climbers wore mountaineering boots, but today we wear rubber shoes that are light and snug. These provide you a greater grip on the rock and help you to wedge your toes into tight spaces to get better grips. The appropriate size of climbing shoes might appear too tiny because of how snugly they fit. 
        It's likely that you'll be climbing with a partner at first. after it's your turn to stay on the ground and belay your partner as they climb, you'll feed the rope through your belay device after it is fastened to your harness. You'll also feed the rope through it when you're rappelling back down the rock after a climb.  These are typically composed of aluminum and available in both easier manual braking variants as well as more difficult assisted braking systems that do some of the work for you.  
        You'll need a locking carabiner to secure your belay device to your harness, and you'll probably want another one to secure your chalk bag as well. A little D-shaped piece of metal with a locking gate is known as a carabiner. You'll want extra carabiners as you begin lead climbing and setting up your own anchors. 
        A chalk bag is just a little canvas bag with a loop that often fastens to the rear of your harness with a carabiner so you can reach back and collect some chalk if your hands start to sweat heavily. The chalk also helps give some grip to your hands and whatever surface you may be climbing. Loose chalk that is sold in resealable packages is known as climbing chalk. Before leaving the house, you can pour a bit inside your climbing backpack.

      <h3>Training advice</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're completely new to the climbing world, or have trained seriously for several years to master a craft, there are sound principles that have been proven to work which you can implement into training. No matter your training plan the key to success is sticking to whatever you have your mind set towards. Here are five ways you can train efficiently for the best results. 
        1. Local Endurance… Local endurance is the capacity to climb simple terrain for an extended amount of time without feeling like too much energy was expended.  ARC training is the most well-known type of regional endurance training for climbers. The purpose of ARC training is to increase the microscopic blood vessels in your forearms. 
        You'll actually increase the number of little blood vessels in your body and widen the ones that are already there if you climb a lot of terrain below your limit. Both adjustments will make it more difficult for a pump to develop, allowing you to climb further and recover more quickly. Implement 15-45 minutes of ARC training weekly to see significant results in your climb. 
        2. Train for stronger fingers…Before each climb actively work your hands and fingers. Begin by going to a hangboard and hanging from the smallest hole solely by your fingertips for five seconds. 
        3. Improve Explosive power…Power is defined as the pace at which you can exert force, or the capacity to make a difficult maneuver rapidly. Consider huge throws, deadpoints, and dynos.To improve these begin with single arm hangs for about 2-5 seconds. Let your arm hang and hold the weight of your body.
